                 <p>Cricket is a popular sport with a long history. It was invented in the 16th century in England, but it was a long time before modern rules were used. It is played between two teams of eleven players each.
                    One team, which is batting, tries to score runs, while the other team is fielding, and tries to prevent this.</p>

                 <p>It is widely assumed that the word "football" refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball.
                    There is an alternative explanation, which is that football originally referred to a variety of games in medieval Europe that were played on foot.</p>
